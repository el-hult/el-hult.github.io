I am a postdoctoral researcher at Uppsala University, in the EmergAI project. Led by [Johan Sundström](https://www.uu.se/kontakt-och-organisation/personal?query=N96-3430), professor in clinical epidemiology, we research how AI can improve the emergency care through predictive models. 
My main research interests are in statistical machine learning, in problems where inference is complicated both by distribution shifts and actions taken both by systems and humans. Healthcare provides a rich source for such problems, and a setting where the research can make real impact.
My PhD studies were supervised by [Dave Zachariah](https://www.it.uu.se/katalog/davza513) and co-supervised by [Thomas Schön](https://user.it.uu.se/~thosc112/index.html).
