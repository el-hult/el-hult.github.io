I am a PhD student at Uppsala University, the [division for Systems and Control](https://www.it.uu.se/about_us/divisions/systems_and_control). 
My main research interests are in statistical machine learning, in problems where inference is complicated both by distribution shifts and actions taken both by systems and humans.
I am supervised by [Dave Zachariah](https://www.it.uu.se/katalog/davza513) and co-supervised by [Thomas Sch√∂n](https://user.it.uu.se/~thosc112/index.html).

This blog is for my personal publication - a collection of notes related to research, hobbies, teaching, and more.
