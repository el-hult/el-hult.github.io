# About
This is a kind of blog for Ludvig Hult, to save some thoughts for his own sake, and possibly to the benefit of others who are confused about maths, latex, programming and other related things.

# Posts

I really want to use this for posting blog-like articles related to my research and readings.

Here they are

<ul>
  {% for post in site.posts %}
    <li>
      <a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
    </li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>

## CV
There might be a CV here at some point. 

## Social media 
There might be some social media links here at some point.
