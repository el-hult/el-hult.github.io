What is the best QP solver for kernel mean matching? 

I want to solve the QP problem

$$
\begin{align*}
\min_{w \in \mathbb{R}^n} \frac{1}{2} w^T K w - \kappa{}^Tw \\
0 \leq w \leq B \\
\lvert \sum_{i=1}^n w_i - n \rvert = n \epsilon
\end{align*}
$$

 where $$\epsilon$$ is some small number, $$B > 0$$ is some upper bound, $$K$$ is a positive semi-definite matrix and $$\kappa$$ is a vector. The problem arise in kernel mean matching (see [Gretton et al 2008](http://mitpress.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.7551/mitpress/9780262170055.001.0001/upso-9780262170055-chapter-8) for more details). 
 The quadratic coefficients are $$K[i,j] = k(x_i,x_j)$$, where $$k$$ is a kernel function and $$x_i$$ are data points from the training data set.
 The linear coefficients are given by $$\kappa[i] = n \frac{1}{n_{te}}\sum_{j=1}^{n_{te}} k(x_i,y_j)$$, where $$y_j$$ are data points from the test data set, of size $$n_{te}$$.

I simplify the problem by replacing $$\lvert \sum_{i=1}^n w_i - n \rvert = n \epsilon $$ with $$\sum_{i=1}^n w_i = n$$. As they point out in the paper, this should have very little impact if $$n$$ is large.
Doing this removes a hyper parameter and a variable from the problem.
I selected $$B=100$$, quite arbitrarily.

To numerical precision, the matrix $$K$$ may not be positive semi-definite (PSD).
In my case it has several eigenvalues at zero. 
Due to numerical imprecision, some turn out small and negative.
This is a problem for the solvers, since they require the matrix to be PSD.
We must stabilize the problem somehow.
I first tried projection to the PSD cone via eigenvalue pruning.
This means we compute the eigenvalue decomposition of $$K$$, and set all negative eigenvalues to zero.
$$V$$ is the matrix of eigenvectors and $$\Lambda$$ is the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues. The eigenvalues are sorted so that $$\lambda_1 \geq \lambda_2 \geq ... \geq \lambda_n$$. The expression $$(\lambda_i)^+ = \max{}(0,\lambda_i)$$ is the ReLU, i.e. replace by zero if negative.

$$ 
\begin{align*}
K = V \Lambda V^T = V \operatorname{diag}( \lambda_1, ..., \lambda_n ) V^T \\
K^{proj} = V \operatorname{diag}( (\lambda_1)^+, ... , (\lambda_n)^+ ) V^T 
\end{align*}
$$

Unfortunately, numerical errors sometimes made it so that the resulting matrix still was not positive semi-definite, despite this procedure.

Next attempt was introducing a diagonal shift. I use an RBF kernel for $$k(\cdot,\cdot)$$, so $$k[i,i]=1$$ always.
The off diagonal elements $$K[i,j] < 1$$ if $$i\neq{}j$$.
Adding a small constant to the diagonal should shift the spectrum towards nonnegative values.
This is a standard trick in gaussian process regression, where it corresponds to adding L2 regularization. 
It seems like a natural thing to try here as well. 
The exact size of the perturbations of the eigenvalues should be given by the Gershgorin circle theorem (also called the GerÅ¡gorin Discs).
I did not do the full analysis, but that could be a starting point for anyone who wants to look into this further.
The formula I use is

$$ K^{shift} = K + I (e - \lambda_n) $$

where $$I$$ is the identity matrix. The most negative eigenvalue is $$\lambda_n$$. The offset $$e$$ is just for numerical stability. I chose $$e=10^{-3}$$. This seemed to solve my precision issues.

So which solver should I use?

## Result from first runs

I set up a handful of solvers on my Macbook Pro M1 (8 cores and 32GB of RAM). I subsample $$m$$ data points wh n constructoring the $$K$$ and $$\kappa$$ matrices, I prune the psd-ness with the shifting method, and I run the solvers on progressively larger problems until a single solve takes more than 60 seconds or the problem size is larger than 13000. 
The time for shifting eigenvalues is excluded since it is the same for all solvers.
I tried `scipy.optimize.minimize`, `mosek`, `cvxpy`, `cvxopt` and `qpsolvers`. All but `mosek` has a wide variety of solver backends.

From early exploration, I decided to skip
 -  `scipy.optimize.minimize` since it is very slow on large problems. It was the only non-dedicated QP solver in this benchmark.
 - `qpsolvers-highs` also slowed down catastrophically on larger problems. I think it is tuned to be good on sparse problems.
 - `qpsolvers-ecos` did not believe my matrix was positive semi-definite, despite my efforts.
 - `qpsolvers-proxqp` since it needed some `libc++` version I had not installed on my macbook.

Skipping these, I tried a couple of backends for each library, and recorded the solve time.

From this, I learn:

- `mosek` has nicer asymptotics, but higher set up cost.
- `scs` and `cvxopt` are quite similar in runtime.
- All runs using `cvxpy` as a frontend failed. It had worked on my toy problem for developing the code, but on the real problem, it failed. Maybe it does some preprocessing, maybe I did some mistake. It does seem however, that there are promising backends available to me in the other libraries, so I could just use those instead.

I did check the values of the solutions found, and all solvers were really close. So we can now move on to the next step, which is to try to solve the problem on more data.

## Fewer solvers, larger problems

I wanted to look in to `scs`, `mosek` and `cvxopt`. The runtime is reported relative to `cvxopt`

{%include image name="runtime2_laptop.png" caption="Runtime from second run on my laptop." %}

From this, I learn that `cvxopt` is fastest as the problem scales up. Running it via the `qpsolvers` frontend was a setup cost of ca 10% (ca 1 minute).

SCS seemed so promising at smaller sample sizes that I spent the time to learn its API and encode the problem both in two different ways.
A box constraint like $$0 \leq w \leq B$$ can be encoded in two different ways: **(1) Linear cone** uses two separate constraints $$-w+s_1 =0$$ and $$w+s_2 = B$$, with the slack variables $$s_1, s_2 \geq 0$$ lying in the linear cone (`scs-l` in the plot), or **(2) Box cone** (`scs-box` in the plot), meaning we encode the constraint as $$w+s=0$$, with $$-tB <= s <= t0$$, and adding a new constraint $$t = 1$$. This reduces the number of slack variables, but we see in the runtime it is much more expensive to compute.

SCS can be compiled with MKL support, which I could use on my compute server. That was a speedup of 20% or so. There is also some sort of CUDA support in SCS, but the documentation is a bit lacking, and I did not manage to install it. This might have to be a exploration for another time.

## Conclusion

The general learning is that you should try different solvers on your problem. The problem size and structure matters a lot.
When you have found a solver that seems right, investigate how it scales. Learnings from one problem size may not be valid for another.
If you need to solve the program many times, you should circumvent the frontend and use the optimizer directly. You may shave off some time by skipping the problem setup cost, and you may get access to more advanced features.
