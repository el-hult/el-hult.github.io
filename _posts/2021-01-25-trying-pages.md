title:  "Trying GitHub Pages"
---
So I thought I'd write a line about how it is to have a first experience in using GitHub Pages.

MAking a minimal start is simple. But getting Latex rendering to work is more difficult. Especially since I have not used Jekyll before.
So this post is simply me trying to understand how posts work. 

Enjoy!
