This is a repo for my personal publication on github. 

You may use information here as you like, as long as you give credit to me and let others improve on your work too!

More specificly, I use the https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/ license

Locally, where I have drafts, I run 

```
bundle exec jekyll serve --force_polling --livereload --draft --incremental
```

please also double check that the Github API key is present in a .env-file and that the key has not expired
(check settings -> developer settings -> personal access tokens)
